## 🎯 Intentional TODOs for Contributors

The project includes several intentional areas for improvement that contributors can work on:

### High Priority
1. **Add email/SMS renewal reminders** - Integration with notification services
2. **Add Pie Chart for category-wise spending** - Enhanced visualization in report.py
3. **Fix bug: sorting renewals by date sometimes fails if format changes** - Date parsing robustness
4. **Improve CLI with colored output using rich** - Better user experience
5. **Add Export to Excel (XLSX) feature** - Data export functionality

### Future Extensions
1. **Add Login system for multiple users** - Multi-user support
2. **Write unit tests for utils.py functions** - Test coverage
3. **Web interface** - Browser-based access
4. **Mobile app** - Cross-platform mobile support

## 📊 Sample Data Generated

The demo creates 6 sample subscriptions:
- Netflix (Streaming) - $15.99/month
- Spotify Premium (Music) - $9.99/month
- Adobe Creative Cloud (Software) - $52.99/month
- Microsoft 365 (Productivity) - $6.99/month
- Dropbox Plus (Cloud Storage) - $9.99/month
- The New York Times (News & Media) - $17.00/month

**Total Monthly Cost**: $112.95
**Total Annual Cost**: $1,355.40

## 🧪 Testing Results

- ✅ **Database Operations** - All CRUD operations working correctly
- ✅ **Report Generation** - All reports and charts generated successfully
- ✅ **CLI Interface** - Interactive menu system working properly
